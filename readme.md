###__Journey of a Ukrainian Refugee Family__

##### This map traces a potential route of a Ukrainian refugee family to leave the southern city of Mykolaiv and travel to Paris in Western Europe. Mykolaiv is close to the front lines of the current war, and Russian forces have bombed it regularly since February 2022. Along the route, the family would travel through five major European cities, which are highlighted on the map by the placement markers. The markers display the city name when hovered over. The purple dashed route gives the approximate overland route through Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany, and France. Note that this route also serves as a conduit for refugee families to return to Ukraine, along with humanitarian aid from Europe to be delivered to southern Ukraine. The map's data source is Google Maps, and the basemap is OpenstreetMap.Mapnik. The basemap is available [here](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/). The javascript libraries used in creating this map include JQuery 3.1.1 and Leaflet 1.0.1.
